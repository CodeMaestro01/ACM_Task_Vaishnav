Hey I'm Vaishnav P Nair from CSE batch.I come from Kottayam. I had studied CS in my higher secondary and I'vd loved programming ever since I started doing it. I always wanted to learn more in programming and never got tired of it. One of the basic reasons for choosing Amrita is its clubs. I see this club as a very good opportunity to improve my logical skills through competitive programming(CP). I like to learn new languages and also take part in competitions. I can contribute to the club through my achievements and can help out my peers and the upcoming juniors with anything and everything I know. I'm ready to work on any tasks the club assigns me and will try my level best to complete those tasks. That's all about me. Thank you...
